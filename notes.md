# Intro to React and Props

## What is React? :thinking:

* A JavaScript library, not a framework
* An open source project created by Facebook
* Used to build front end user interfaces
* The view layer of the MVC application
* Component based and uses state and props to streamline how data is stored and used
* You can use a small part of react in website or build interactive SPA with React
* [React JS Docs](https://reactjs.org/)

## React Features

* Virtual DOM - allows for fast, efficient, content rendering [Doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#:~:text=The%20virtual%20DOM%20(VDOM)%20is,This%20process%20is%20called%20reconciliation.&text=They%20may%20also%20be%20considered,virtual%20DOM%E2%80%9D%20implementation%20in%20React.)
* Declarative writing structure - allows you to simply express how your app should look and let React handle updates and underlying data changes
* Babel - transpiler that converts modern JavaScript and custom code like JSX into more widely compatible JavaScript; [Doc](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)
* Webpack - a 'bundler' that takes all our work, along with any required dependency code, and packages it all up in a single, transferable bundle [Doc](https://webpack.js.org/)
* ESLint - helps improve our code [Doc](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

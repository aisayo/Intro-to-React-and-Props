# Intro to React and Props

## What is React? :thinking:

* A JavaScript library, not a framework
* An open source project created by Facebook
* Used to build front end user interfaces
* The view layer of the MVC application
* Component based and uses state and props to streamline how data is stored and used
* You can use a small part of react in website or build interactive SPA with React
* [React JS Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
